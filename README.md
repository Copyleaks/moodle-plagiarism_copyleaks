Copyleaks Plagiarism Plugin for Moodle 3.5+
=====================================
Copyleaks Plagiarism checker is a simple and easy-to-use integration system that thoroughly scans student assignments directly from the platform to check for plagiarism. All submitted projects and research papers can be quickly reviewed from your LMS platforms during the grading procedure. The Copyleaks plagiarism checker will generate a similarity report and detailed result for the educators so that they can check for copied contents present in a research paper or scientific paper.
